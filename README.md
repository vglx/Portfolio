Reflection 1:

During my internship, a department that has nothing to do with me came to me, hoping that I could develop a script for them to process Excel files. At the time, I had major work tasks unfinished, but they seemed eager for me to help them. After some thought and evaluation, I predict that developing such a script will take me a lot of time. In the end, I decided to deny their request.

I was flattered when they first contacted me because I felt considered capable and qualified to do this. However, when I realized I was running out of time, I felt a little anxious. I don't want to disappoint them, but I also know I have other responsibilities. In the end, I decided to turn them down with some guilt and concern that they might misunderstand me.

On the positive side, I realized my time management and task evaluation abilities. Rather than accepting assignments blindly, I chose to assess my abilities and current workload. On the negative side, I may have lost opportunities to work with other departments, as well as opportunities to showcase my skills.

From this experience, I realized the importance of open communication. It might be easier for them to understand my decision-making if I could communicate my work schedule and time constraints to them more clearly. Also, I also recognize the limitations of being an intern and that more time and experience may be needed to handle situations like this.

This experience made me realize my strengths and limitations. In the future, I will pay more attention to communication with other departments in order to better coordinate and balance the work. At the same time, I also need to learn how to better assess the difficulty and time required for tasks.

In order to avoid similar situations from happening again, I plan to improve my communication skills, especially when evaluating and accepting tasks. And update my work progress regularly so that other departments can understand my work load. Finally learning more time management and task evaluation skills to help me balance work better.

All in all, while I declined their request, the experience provided me with an opportunity to learn and grow.

Reflection 2:

During my internship, I took over a project with the goal of optimizing a multi-terminal control system for the company's test vehicle parking lot. However, one of the major problems I faced was that most of the developers who were responsible for the project had left and the documentation of the program was severely lacking.

After the initial introduction to the project, I felt very anxious and restless. The lack of adequate documentation cost me a lot of time in understanding and continuing to develop the project. At the same time, I was also feeling a little frustrated as I realized that this project could have gone much smoother with full documentation.

On the positive side, this experience taught me the importance of project documentation and the value of communication between teams. On the negative side, I encountered a lot of unnecessary roadblocks on the project due to lack of effective documentation and handoffs.

The continuity and stability of the project depends heavily on good documentation and effective task handover. This experience underscores how important it is to maintain complete and updated documentation when there is regular turnover in the team.

This experience made it even more clear to me that regardless of the size of the project, it is important to maintain detailed and complete documentation and ensure adequate task handover when team members change. This way, new members can more easily integrate into the project and continue to advance the work.

In order to avoid similar problems in future work, I plan to always ensure that detailed documentation is maintained and updated in any project. And promote and emphasize the importance of documentation in the team. When team members change, create a detailed handover plan that ensures new members understand their responsibilities and the ins and outs of the project. Although this challenge brought short-term troubles, it also provided me with valuable experience and profound lessons.
